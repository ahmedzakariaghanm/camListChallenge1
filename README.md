## Installation and run

To Run the project, Clone it to your local machine

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

## End Points

Use first end point: http://localhost:5000/pet/bid To add a bid on a pet
Use the 2nd end point: http://localhost:5000/pet/bid/:petId To list all bids on a pet

## Assumptions

I assume that we have 3 Pets using ids from 1:3 pets and 4 users using ids from 1:4
Every user can bids on any pet he want any number of bids but the bid will be the final bid
